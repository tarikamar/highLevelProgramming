# The C language 🧪
## Key points 🚀
The C language is a high level language with access to low level features such as :

- *No memory management* 😁
- Therefore *garbage collection* is not done for you 🤨

The C language is : 

- *Imperative* : It pushes you to describe how the program should acomplish the task
- *Static, Compiled* : Translation happens before run,time for the language and the data types.
- *Weakly typed*, because you can cast any type to any other type.
