Exercises

1. Is #include <stdio.h> the same as #include "stdio.h"?
A: Angle brackets makes the preprocessor search for stdio.h outside the current directory
but double quotes makes it search for the same file inside the current directory


2.It's time for you to write your own first program. Referring to the program
in Listing 2.1, write a C program that can print out a message: It's fun to write
my own program in C.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf(" It's fun to write your own program in C.");
	return 0;

}

3.Update the program in Listing 2.1 by adding one more newline character into
the message printed out by the printf() function. You should see two lines of the message 
on the screen after running the updated executable file:
Howdy, neighbor!
This is my first C program.

A:  #include <stdio.h>

int main()
  {
     printf ("Howdy, neighbor!\nThis is my first C program.\n");
     return 0;
  }

4. What warning or error messages will you get when you're trying to compile the following program?

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
	main()
	{
	   printf ("Howdy, neighbor! This is my first C program.\n");
	   exit(0);
	}

A: It will ask me to add a value type to main.

5. What error messages will you get when you're trying to compile the following program?

void main()
{
   printf ("Howdy, neighbor! This is my first C program.\n");
   return 0;
}

A: Void means that main has no type value, and the return statement cannot return a value
