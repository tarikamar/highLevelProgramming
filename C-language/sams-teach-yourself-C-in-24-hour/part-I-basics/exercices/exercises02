Given two statements, x = 3; and y = 5 + x;, how can you build a statement block with the two statements?
{
	int x;
	int y;
}
int main(int x, int y){
	x = 3;
	y = 5 + x;
	return y; 
}


What is wrong with the following function?
int 3integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
{
   int sum;
   sum = x + y + z;
   return sum;
}  
A: you can't name a function with a number at the begining
What is wrong with the following function?

int integer_add( int x, int y, int z)
{
   int sum;
   sum = x + y + z
   return sum;
}
A : second statement lacks a semicolon 
Write a C function that can multiply two integers and return the calculated result.

int multiplyInt(int x, int y){
	int result;
	result = x*y;
	return result;
}

Write a C program that calls the C function you just wrote in exercise 4 to calculate the multiplication of 3 times 5 and then print out the return value from the function on the screen.

int main(){
	int sum;
	sum = multiplyInt(3, 5);
	printf("3 multiplied by 5 %i\n", sum)
	return 0;;
}
